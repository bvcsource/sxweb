## DEBUG

If you need to debug issues with SXWeb, it's recommended to turn on development mode.
Create the file public/config.inc.php with the following content:

    <?php
    define('APPLICATION_ENV','development');
    ?>

You need the `development` section into your `skylable.ini` and `application.ini` files for this to work.

You can increase the verbosity of the logs by editing the file `application/configs/application.ini`.
