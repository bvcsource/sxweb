# DEPLOY INSTRUCTIONS

## DATABASE
All database schema are into the `sql/` directory. Create the database using sxweb.sql, then apply all the update_DDMMYYY.sql files
you'll find into that dir in time order (the DDMMYYY part of the file name stands for date-month-year).

## DIRECTORIES
Create and make writable by the web server these directories:

 - data/
 - data/session/
 - data/logs/

## APPLICATION

1) MANDATORY - Edit the file application/configs/skylable.ini to suits your needs.
Remember that all the settings into the 'production' profile will be use into the production environment.

IMPORTANT: the 'auth_salt' is the salt used to crypt and decrypt, once generated one, don't change it, or 
users will not be able to login

First thing to do is to set up you SX cluster address, the DB connection parameters and the SMTP. Then fine tune the application to suits your needs.

2) OPTIONAL - Edit the application/configs/application.ini
Editing this file is not mandatory, usually you can leave it as is. For debugging purpouse you can change the logging level and some application parameters.

By default it forces PHP to store sessions data locally.

3) OPTIONAL - Create the file public/config.inc.php

This file is read before any other file, so you can use it to set some constants or special PHP settings that you need.

As an example, you can set this constant to use the site in "development mode":

<?php
define('APPLICATION_ENV','development');
?>

## WEB SERVER

Your web server webroot must point to the public/ directory.

## CAVEAT

If you get 403 Forbidden, make sure that SELinux is not interfering with the application. 
Check /var/log/audit.log and if required run:

# chcon -Rt httpd_sys_content_t /path/to/sxweb
