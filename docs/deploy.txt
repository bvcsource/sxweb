# DEPLOY INSTRUCTIONS

## DATABASE
All database schema are into the `sql/` directory. Create the database using sxweb.sql, then apply all the update_DDMMYYY.sql files
you'll find into that dir in time order (the DDMMYYY part of the file name stands for date-month-year).

## DIRECTORIES
Create and make writable by the web server the dirs:

 - data/
 - data/session/
 - data/logs/

## APPLICATION
1) Edit the file public/config.inc.php setting the application environment to 'production', search the line:

<?php
define('APPLICATION_ENV','development');
?>

And change it to:

<?php
define('APPLICATION_ENV','production');
?>

In this file you can also put all PHP settings you need.

2) Edit the file application/configs/skylable.ini to suits your needs.
Remember that all the settings into the 'production' profile will be use into the production environment.
Unless you are developing, leave as is the 'development' section.

IMPORTANT: the 'auth_salt' is the salt used to crypt and decrypt, once generated one, don't change it, or 
users will not be able to login

3) Edit the application/configs/application.ini
Here you can define your SMTP settings, the DB connection parameters, the logging level and in general application parameters.

I suggest to change only the SMTP and DB settings.
