# Users table
The table 'users' contains all the users.
Passwords are MD5 hashes obtained in this way: MD5( CONCAT( plain_password, secret_salt ) ), where "plain_password" is 
the plain password the user choice, and "secret_salt" is a string salt stored into the skylable.ini config file (under
the key: "auth_salt")

IMPORTANT: Once deployed the application, don't change the secret salt or the users will not be able to login (they should reset 
their passwords).

# Shared table

The table 'shared' table contains the shared files info. There are some caveats due to retro compatibility and misleading column names.

The primary key 'key' field is a string obtained doing the sha1 of UUID().

The 'url' field contains the path (not the URL) of the file on the SX Cluster, the path is the complete path including volume informations.

The 'file' field contains only the file name (is the basename of the path)

The 'hash' field contains the sha1 of the path.

So, if your path is '/foo/bar/myfile.txt' and your user id is 10, you can create a new record and get the generated key doing:

INSERT INTO `shared` (`key`, `userid`, `url`, `file`, `hash`) SELECT @lastkey := SHA1(UUID()), 10, '/foo/bar/myfile.txt', 'myfile.txt', SHA1('/foo/bar/myfile.txt');
SELECT @lastkey
